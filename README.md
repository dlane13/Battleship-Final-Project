Here lies my final project for Intermediate Programming! We learned Java in this class, so the entire project is written in Java. It relies heavily on Object-Oriented Programming to create a version of the board game Battleship. The game is played by the user in the console, and they play against the computer.
The basic requirement for the project was that the computer makes random moves, but I took the option to implement more intelligence in the computer's moves, which can be found in the UserBoard class under the makeComputerMove method.
